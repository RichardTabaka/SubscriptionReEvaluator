# SubscriptionReEvaluator
 Re-model of the Subscription Value Calculator console app to include a GUI and more functionality. This app saved me 30% on my subscriptions per month so I figured it deserved a facelift and more time/effort.

# So What Does It Do?
* Allows the user to input their subscriptions and how much they cost per month
* Edit the time they've spent watching these descriptions and their costs
* Track their time spent in each subscription with the 'Watching' window
* View and compare the relative value of each subscription they have

# To Do:
* Improve GUI(could be prettier) and icon
* Move away from stack panels to more free-form windows
* Fix ValueWindow to not just be a popup and be a window like the rest
* Implement a refresh based on month to get accurate values
* Implement similar function for, say, VideoGames/purchased movies where there is an up-front cost but the value from it only ever increases. Would be a nifty comparison to see if subscriptions save or cost you money in the long run
